                        <h1>WHY SHOULD I TRAIN LEGS?</h1>
                        <p>No matter what your goals are, there are many health benefits when it comes to training legs. This includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improving functional strength: helping you do daily activities at ease such as walking, sitting down and standing back up.</li>
                            <li>Improving muscle building efforts: Some of our leg muscles are the largest in our body, meaning that working on these large muscle groups will allow you to effectively build more muscle mass and increase strength.</li>
                            <li>Symmetry: Although having a symmetrical balanced physique is more of an aesthetic concern, it is also important to recognise that combining lower body training with upper body will carry over to your results and performance in the gym. </li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <p>So whether you're new to working out or a fitness pro, leg exercises are a staple to include in your exercise routine. Tone your lower body with the leg exercises below, ranging from squats, deadlifts, lunges and glute bridges.</p>

                            <p>There are more reasons to train your upper body than just to look good on the beach. Upper body strength is useful for lifting everyday items, can improve our posture, reduces the risk of injuries and enhances sporting performance. A good upper body program should include pushing and pulling exercises in all directions.</p>
